# Redux Book List App
A simple book list app

## Dear prospect employers/recruiters
- I am really trying hard to get my skill level up par to your expectations.
- This is how I work. I google a lot and read plenty of documentation.
- I always reference to my Github because there are things that I have done before and I cannot recall every line of code that I have written.
- I do not memorise everything but rest assured that these GitHub projects are indexed in my head like a database.
- Please expect quality work and products when you decide to hire me because I do care a lot about my customers and the company I represent.
